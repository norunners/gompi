GoMPI: Message Passing Interface for Parallel Computing

The `gompi` package is a lightweight wrapper to the [OpenMPI](https://www.open-mpi.org) C++ library
designed to develop algorithms for parallel computing.

GoMPI is a fork of the [gosl MPI](https://github.com/cpmech/gosl/mpi) package with additional methods.

## Installation

1) install [OpenMPI](https://www.open-mpi.org) for your system
2) ensure  [golang.org/x/tools/cmd/stringer](https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/tools/cmd/stringer) is installed (`go get` if not)
